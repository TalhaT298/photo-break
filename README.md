## How It Works

1. **Dynamic Grid:**  
   JavaScript creates a grid of tiles, each displaying a section of the full image.

2. **Animations:**  
   Clicking the button toggles the `.big` class, expanding the grid and animating tiles.

3. **Styling:**  
   CSS defines the layout, animations, and responsive design.
